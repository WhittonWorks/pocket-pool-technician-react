  "symptoms": [
    {
      "symptom": "Heat pump will not start (no display)",
      "causes": [
        "Breaker/fuse tripped",
        "No line power to unit",
        "Phase reversal or phase loss (3-phase only)"
      ],
      "actions": [
        "Check and reset breaker/fuse",
        "Verify 240 VAC supply at input",
        "For 3-phase units: verify correct phasing and no phase loss"
      ]
    },
    {
      "symptom": "Heat pump will not start (display ON)",
      "causes": [
        "Startup delay active (up to 5 minutes)",
        "Thermostat not calling for heat"
      ],
      "actions": [
        "Wait until delay completes",
        "Verify correct mode and temperature set point"

      "symptom": "Heat pump runs but does not heat",
      "causes": [
        "Air coil not exhausting properly",
        "New installation (short runtime)",
        "Insufficient pump runtime",
        "Return air intake dampers closed"
      ],
      "actions": [
        "Verify strong airflow out the top of unit",
        "Allow 24–48 hrs of continuous operation after install",
        "Increase pump runtime or use Maintain Heat mode",
        "Ensure intake dampers are open"
      ]

    {
      "symptom": "FAULT — NO FLOW",
      "causes": [
        "Pump off",
        "Valves in incorrect position",
        "Dirty filter/skimmer",
        "Low pool water level",
        "Water features bypassing heat pump"
      ],
      "actions": [
        "Turn pump ON",
        "Verify valve positions",
        "Clean filter/skimmers",
        "Top off pool water",
        "Temporarily turn off fountains/water features"
      ]
    },
    {
      "symptom": "FAULT — HIGH REF PRESSURE",
      "causes": [
        "Water flow restriction",
        "Low pump speed (VS/2-speed pumps)",
        "Closed valves or dirty filter",
        "Low pool water level"
      ],
      "actions": [
        "Verify pump running",
        "Switch to higher pump speed",
        "Clean filter/skimmers and confirm valves open",
        "Top off pool water"
      ]
    },
    {
      "symptom": "FAULT — LOW REF PRESSURE",
      "causes": [
        "Ambient temperature too low",
        "Fan not operating",
        "Low refrigerant or restriction"
      ],
      "actions": [
        "Normal if pool water < 50°F",
        "Check fan operation (air out the top)",
        "If persists → call for service"

        "Plumbing leak",
        "Heat exchanger leak"
      ],
      "actions": [
        "Turn pump OFF for 1 hr → if water stops, it’s condensation",
        "If water continues, inspect plumbing",
        "If leak persists, call for service"
