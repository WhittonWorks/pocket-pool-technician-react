    {
      "symptom": "Heater will not power on",
      "causes": [
        "No incoming line voltage",
        "Blown fuse",
        "Defective transformer"
      ],
      "actions": [
        "Verify 120/240 VAC at input terminals",
        "Check fuse on PIB and replace if blown",
        "Measure transformer secondary (22–26 VAC); replace if out of range"

      "symptom": "Blower not operating",

        "Low supply voltage"
      ],
      "actions": [
        "Measure voltage at Ignition Control K & I terminals (should be 105–130 VAC)",
        "Measure igniter resistance (40–75 Ω). Replace if open",
