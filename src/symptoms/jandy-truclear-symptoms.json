    {
      "id": "truclear-symptom-01",
      "title": "Low or no chlorine",
      "meaning": "Possible causes: Low stabilizer (cyanuric acid), pH out of range (7.4–7.6), insufficient operating hours, chlorine output % too low, temporary chlorine loss from heavy organic load, low salt (<3000 ppm), high nitrate level, metals in pool water, new pool not shocked properly, clogged/dirty cell.",
      "fix": "Actions: Add stabilizer to 30–50 ppm, adjust pH to 7.4–7.6, increase operating time, increase output %, run pump/cell 24 hrs and shock if needed, test/add salt to 3000–3500 ppm, contact pool professional for nitrates/metals, super chlorinate new water, clean cell per manual."
    },
    {
      "id": "truclear-symptom-02",
      "title": "Chlorine level too high (>7 ppm)",
      "meaning": "Possible causes: Output % set too high, power pack & cell running too long.",
      "fix": "Actions: Decrease chlorine production, reduce run time."
    },
    {
      "id": "truclear-symptom-03",
      "title": "No display on LCD (screen blank)",
      "meaning": "Possible cause: No power to unit.",
      "fix": "Actions: Check pump timer connection, check if GFCI is tripped."

    {
      "id": "truclear-symptom-04",
      "title": "Display says 'No Flow'",
      "meaning": "Possible causes: Insufficient water flow, dirty filter, poor connection between cell & power pack, closed valves, pump undersized/failing.",
      "fix": "Actions: Clean pump/skimmer baskets, clean filter, verify cell connection, check valve alignment, check pump size/operation."
    },
    {
      "id": "truclear-symptom-05",
      "title": "Display says 'Lo Tmp/Lo Salt'",
      "meaning": "Possible causes: Salt <2500 ppm, calcium buildup, expired cell, combo of low temp (35–65°F) & low salt (1500–2000 ppm).",
      "fix": "Actions: Maintain 3000–3500 ppm salinity, clean cell, replace if expired, adjust salt depending on water temp."
    },
    {
      "id": "truclear-symptom-06",
      "title": "Salt level too low",
      "meaning": "Possible causes: Not enough salt added, leak in pool.",
      "fix": "Actions: Add salt to 3000 ppm, repair leak."
    },
    {
      "id": "truclear-symptom-07",
      "title": "Salt level too high",
      "meaning": "Possible causes: Too much salt, debris between plates.",
      "fix": "Actions: Backwash/drain/dilute pool to 3000–3500 ppm, remove debris/clean/replace cell."

      "id": "truclear-symptom-08",
      "title": "Strong chlorine odor",
      "meaning": "Possible causes: Excess chloramines, oxidized organic waste.",
      "fix": "Actions: Manually shock pool, if odor persists >12 hrs, take water sample to dealer."

    {
      "id": "truclear-symptom-09",
      "title": "Cloudy water or slimy walls",
      "meaning": "Possible cause: Algae/bacteria growth.",

    {
      "id": "truclear-symptom-10",
      "title": "Eye or skin irritation",
      "meaning": "Possible causes: Improper water balance, high chloramines.",
      "fix": "Actions: Balance water, raise output to 100% & run pump 24 hrs (no swimming)."

    {
      "id": "truclear-symptom-11",
      "title": "Scale formation on equipment",
      "meaning": "Possible causes: High calcium hardness, incorrect pH (mineral precipitation).",
      "fix": "Actions: Dilute water, use sequestering agent if needed, adjust alkalinity 80–120 ppm, pH to 7.4–7.6."
